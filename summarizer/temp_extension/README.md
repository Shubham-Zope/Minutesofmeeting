A Chrome Extension that gives you transcript of google meet. Start captions and all the script will be saved in chrome storage which can be downloaded in pdf format.
Helps you keep a record of all the conversation that took place on **_GOOGLE MEET_**.

## Working

**This extension doesn't recognize speech rather the speech-to-text conversion is done by google meet itself. So it is necessary to put _captions on_ to get the transcript of the meet.**

The background script keeps on observing the captions and saves in _chrome storage_. When you click the download button it takes all the transcript which has been saved till that moment in the storage ,compiles it into pdf and then serves you. Data automatically gets deleted when a new meeting is joined.
